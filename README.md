# Snakegame
I tried to program a snack game using the library Pygame.

In this code you will see that I tried all my best to use almost all the function that I had learn in this library. 

For example :
  -pygame.display.set_caption() : to set the current window caption.
  -pygame.display.set_mode() : Initialize a window or screen were I can put my snake to play.
  -pygame.Color() : chose calors.
  -pygame.time.Clock() :create an object to help track time
  
And many function that you will find in my code.
